# Backtesting
The bot Screener searchs for best cryptos that goes along with my strategy
,and the bot R_R_backtest backtests on historical market data and gives what risk to reward ratio would have been the most profitable.

I have attached a spreadsheet, so you can record each risk to riward ratio with their corresponding winrate(actually the the spreadsheet already have functions to do that if needed).

## why
The Reason that r:r backtester is important is because trades give extremely different output with different parameters like risk to reward, timeframe
  so, I will also add more backtesters on additional factors like timeframe, market structure...
